# I’m Something of a Painter Myself

This is my solution for the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started), where the goal is to generate images in the style of a famous painter – Claude Monet. For this task, I used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a CycleGAN architecture. The architecture is presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593) by Jun-Yan Zhu et al.
